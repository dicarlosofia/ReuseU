# ReuseU Backend

ReuseU backend is built with Flask and Firebase (for now). To set up backend for local development, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed in your local machine. To check if Python is installed, run this in your command line

```bash
python --version
```

2. Create a new virtual environment and activate it, following this command:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
