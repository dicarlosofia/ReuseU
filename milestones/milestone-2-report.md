# Milestone 2 Report

## Issues Creation

_Create a *Trello board* and start creating issues in it, based on our discussion of agile development._
- Instead of making a Trello board, we discovered that the features it offers are already offered within our GitHub Repo, so we have decided to do our agile development planning there with Leah's counsel. 

<!--
## Start experimenting and setting up resources:

**Background:** 

In a future milestone, you finalize your systemâ€™s architecture and design, but start exploring, and setting up resources. For example, if your project requires setting up a web or SQL server, get started on this task and add relevant instructions and information to your Git repository. Now would also be a good time to do a cost-benefit analysis to help you choose between different programming languages or tools, and to work through tutorials of the programming languages that you will be using. Write about what you did in your written report. By the end of this milestone, you should know what technologies you will be using to implement your product.

## Write-up:

<!--
Your write-up should be written in markdown and should include:
-->

- _The work that each team member completed for this milestone:_
  - **Sofia**: Compiled this writeup, and helped create the first round of Issues for our first sprint. Also provided tutorial resources for the team to use in getting familiar with Python, Javascript, CSS, and HTML.
  - **Howie**: Created a comprehensive list of options for what platforms to use for our databases, frontend hosting, and authentication + user management, and helped explain why they would benefit us.
  - **Peter**:
  - **Trung**: Helped keep track of user story progression for sprint 1. 
  - **Krishna**: Created the beta concept for our mascot.
  - **Timur**:
- _A summary of important decisions that our team made_:
  - We chose which programming languages to work on, and which platforms to use for our databases, frontend hosting, and authentication + user management. We also got our Private Teams channel organized and begun using sprints. 
- _Which programming languages and tools we are using:_
  - Our languages of choice will be Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Python. 
    - **Databases**: 
    - **Frontend hosting**: 
    - **Authentication + User Management**: 
- _How we chose to settle on those technologies:_
  - We wanted to choose these technologies in particular because they already had some functionalities in place that we would not have to do ourselves, such as how Next.js is a React framework that provides features like server side rendering, easy api routes, and some automatic optimizations.
