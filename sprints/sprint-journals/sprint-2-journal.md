# Sprint 2 Journal

## Part 1: Coding Guidelines
   For each programming language that you will use in the implementation of your project, provide a link to a pre-existing coding style guideline that the members of your project will follow. Do not try to make up your own guidelines. Briefly state why you chose those guidelines and how you plan to enforce them.


Coding guidelines should appear in your Repository alongside any existing developer guidelines. Make sure the readme file in the root directory of your repo clearly describes where developer guidelines can be found.
