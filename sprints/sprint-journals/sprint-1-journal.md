![Photo 6](../../assets/prototype/prototype6.jpeg)

### Use Cases Modeled:

1. Use case 1, Lucy creating a listing to sell a phone and then check that it's active
2. Use case 2, Jack finding a lamp from a verified/non-suspicious user that is within his budget.
3. Use case 3, Dexter searching for laptops on ReuseU, checking their conditions through photos, and favoriting listings.

### Demonstrations:

Demonstrations of all three use cases were held in class on February 24th with Destany (da) Best.



## Part 4: Test and revise (practice)


For this part, we tested our prototype with Destany, who was the first person to ever experience our paper website. We prepared a preliminary prototype with multiple pages, set up all of the prototype's components, decided on the team roles for the test and invited Destany to test it during class. The team members took on the following roles during this test:
1. Trung - note taker, wrote down all the feedback and suggestions from Destany (and the team) during the test
2. Howie - also a note taker, same as above.
3. Sofia - facilitator, helped change pages/elements of the website as Destany was interacting with it.
4. Krishna - was involved in creating the Storyboard, otherwise observed the test and offered feedback too.
5. Peter - video recorder.
6. Timur - facilitator also, same as Sofia.

### A short synapsis of the test:
Destany immediately decided to test our website to the limit and decided to create the account instead of logging in with an existing one (our sign up procedure wasn't yet developed at the time but the log in was). She then proceeded to play along with filters and the interface, clicked on a couple listings and was able to message a user she wasy trying to a buy an item for. Destany succesfully pointed out many underdeveloped parts of our prototype and gave us a lot of new elements to develop over the next couple of days. At the time, Lucy's story about creating a listing was activated, as well as Dexter's story about buying a laptop.

### Specific feedback received:
Below are some examples of the specific feedback we received from Destany:

* Noted that there should be a button to create a listing. 
* Wanted filters visible from the start. 
* Disliked blocks on green background, but noted design is subjective. 
* Asked if items can be given for free. 
* Wanted to see an about page. 
* Wanted to see recommended products. 
* Wanted to see more design elements. 
* Asked if there is a rating system or report button for bad actions.

### Changing the prototype:
Upon receiving the feedback above, the team continued to develop, expand, and improve our paper prototype to include:
*  the submission button for when creating a listing, 
* making filters visible form the start, 
* creating an about page, and other details,
* introducing the settings drop down menu with languages and dark mode (though not actually implemented),
* sign up page with email verification and password creation,
* profile page with editing. 

The team worked collectively on this improvement process.



## Part 5: Test and revise (with real stakeholders)
Who you tested it with. - melina 
A narrative describing the test.
What roles did each team member play during the test?
Which user stories were activated?

1. Use case 4, Chara who navigates to the website about page, and looks at a buyer to see if their rating is good, we accept a buy and message them.
3. Use case 3, Dexter searching for laptops on ReuseU, checking their conditions through photos, and favoriting listings.

Additional notes describing the session, e.g. observations of the test user's behavior.
- Had a tough time navigating the UI, seemed stuck at times and did not know what to do
- Did not go to 'your listings' easily. Didn't know that there were many options in the settings menu.
- Claimed things took to long to load (suboptimal scene organization during testing)
- Did not like transitions between scenes

The feedback you got from the tester
- Things should load faster
- The bar on the side to hide the left product filters was way too small
- Coudlnd't tell what was editable on the profile page: email and password is both editable or only password?

Notes on how to revise your testing procedure for the next user
- Guide the user on what their goal is instead of freely roaming the website

Not only will your prototype change, but also, you might choose to change the way you present it to your user.
- We need to organize small paper tabs such as buttons together, we need to create 'scenes' that we can quickly swapped out.

Describe changes to your prototype
- We added animations when loading certain elements such as adding a listing to a add a sense of personality
- Changed the look of the filter minimizing bar to be easily seen
- Addded a lot of back buttons to prevent the user from being stuck in a screen without a way to go back
- 
How your prototype changed based on user feedback
- Made the search bar a bit larger
- Removed some whitespace on the create listing page by making certain text boxes larger

Other changes your team decided to make from your own thoughts and ideas from the testing session
- Add some sort of report button
  
Other things you added to your prototype, not necessarily based on the testing session
- NA

Who you tested it with. - cam

A narrative describing the test. - 
  Cam came up and took control by the reigns. He logged in, and immediately browsed all of our available listings, commenting on each and every one of them
  and their prices. He then wanted to purchase a listing, and was routed to the "buy a computer" listing, commenting on wanting to be able to view a 
  person's profile. He then browsed for a little longer. 
What roles did each team member play during the test?
  Howie - Note taker, Trung - Note taker, Peter - Facilitator, Timur - animation, Sofia - Facilitator, Krishna - handler
Which user stories were activated?
  We used Dexter's user story, navigating to the computer, and buying it.
Additional notes describing the session, e.g. observations of the test user's behavior.
N/A - he just moved fast
The feedback you got from the tester
 - overall well done, *told us to work on our animations and load speed*
Notes on how to revise your testing procedure for the next user
- This one went pretty smoothly, not a lot of notes.
Not only will your prototype change, but also, you might choose to change the way you present it to your user.
Describe changes to your prototype
- We will have a profile section for one's profile, and other people's profiles
how your prototype changed based on user feedback
- Profile section included
other changes your team decided to make from your own thoughts and ideas from the testing session
- Back button implementation
other things you added to your prototype, not necessarily based on the testing session
- N/A
Include one or more photos of your revised prototype where the difference between the original and revised version can be plainly seen

**Who you tested it with.** 
- Mason

A narrative describing the test.
- He was interested mainly in the buying aspect of the prototype. He was a very thorough and tried almost everything that we had to offer.
  
What roles did each team member play during the test?
- Sofia & Peter: facilitator
- Timur: animator/handler
- Peter: facilitator
- Trung & Howie: note-taker

Which user stories were activated?
- Use case 2

Additional notes describing the session, e.g. observations of the test user's behavior.
- Mason was very inquisitive and explored heavily when it came to navigating through our "paper" website.

The feedback you got from the tester
- It would be nice to have all our listing page links in one tab (My Listings, Favorites, Make a Listing).
- Give more ReuseU flavor to the prototype, for example: make a dark mode.

Notes on how to revise your testing procedure for the next user
- Revise the top bar for better user navigation.

_Describe changes to your prototype_
- how your prototype changed based on user feedback
  - Added a top panel
- other changes your team decided to make from your own thoughts and ideas from the testing session
  - Report button on view profile page.
- other things you added to your prototype, not necessarily based on the testing session
  - Made the back buttons more obvious
- **Include one or more photos of your revised prototype where the difference between the original and revised version can be plainly seen**

## Part 7: CIDER Technique

* Critique
What assumptions about users were identified during the critique stage?
  1. Seller has a preferred payment method?
  2. Users must be comfortable in a social interaction with others
  3. Seller might not have a mode of transportation

* Imagine
Which assumption(s) did you choose to expand on for this phase?
How might that assumption exclude users?

  1. Assumption: Specific payment methods could be restrictive, users might not have cash/venmo
  2. Assumption: Selling something large (i.e. a couch, lamp) without a reliable mode of transportation could be difficult

* Design
What are your ideas for redesigning your product based on critique?

  1. We will make preferred payment method tags 
  2. We will add an optional "delivery method" tag
