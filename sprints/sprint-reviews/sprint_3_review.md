## Sprint 2 In Review 

1. _How has your product improved or progressed from a customer perspective? (Describe in terms of high-level features that a non-technical user could recognize and appreciate.)_ 

- Tremendously! We’re finally having our frontend facing parts coming together. We have a full homepage listings page popping up when a user opens a website, we can now filter listings, are almost able to create new listings, as well as view full listings in enlarged format. We can also see our account information page and use a bunch of navigation buttons (reuseU button, back button, etc). 

 

### Features and activation instructions 

**Creating a listing**: In the top right corner (on the dashboard), find and click on the marketplace icon (between the searchbar and the profile icon). Fill in the title, desciption, and price fields, upload photos of the listing, and assign tags to the listing. Then scroll down and click “SUBMIT” button to submit your new listing. 

**Filtering listings**. Use filters on the left to filter by price or tags. For instance, to view listings between $0.00 and $50.00, click on the price drop-down and check the boxes for “Under $10” and also “$10-$50”. To look at laptops, click on the electronics drop-down and check the box next to “laptops” 

**Viewing and editing profile**. To view your profile, simply click on the little person/profile icon in the top left corner on the dashboard (between settings gear icon and the marketplace icon). 

**Viewing a listing in full**. Find a listing of interest and simply click on its title 

**Favoriting a listing**: Find a listing of interest and simply click on the heart in the bottom right corner of the rectangular container. 

**Chats**: In the bottom right corner, find the chat menu/interface. Simply click on the up/down arrod to expand/collapse the chat interface. Click on the user profile to open the respective chat window and type away!

 
 
2. _What progress have you made that is not visible to a common user?_ 

- We have made incredible progress on making database manipulation intuitive and accessible for our front-end team. We currently have transactions, reviews, accounts, listings, and messages as their own tables in the database, and by the end of the sprint, they are all able to be added, read, and deleted properly without causing any major issues to the ReuseU website. We also have integrated data validation tests to make sure that the correct data types are being passed. Additionally, we have made API endpoints for the front-end to connect to, so that the front-end team may use the database directly with the website.
