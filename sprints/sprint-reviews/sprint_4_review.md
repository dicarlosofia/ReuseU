# Sprint 4 Review Report 


## Work Completed 

- **Sofia**: For the sprint, I created a price fill functionality on backend, using open AI. I also worked in collaboration with Timur to fix the message service on the backend.

- **Timur**: Helped identify the cross-platform issue with mac and locahosts vs explicit ip address. Interviewed Melina, one of the stakeholders. Helped on the backend and worked collaboratively with Sofia on message services.

- **Trung**:  I refactored API routes for better error handling, assisted Krishna in configuring GitHub Actions for automated testing and helped frontend displaying image from blob storage

- **Howie**: Further frontend development, interviewed two stakeholders (mason and cam). Created user-facing documentation.

- **Peter**: I implemented blob storage for uploading and receiving one or multiple images for a particular listing. The listing routes automatically handle image data. I also implemented image downscaling during listing creation.
 
- **Krishna**: I’ve made significant progress on the CI/CD testing suite and automation. When a push is made, the test files now run automatically. All that remains now is to implement automated deployment and similar test files for newly implemented chat functions.

For instance, to view listings between $0.00 and $50.00, click on the price drop-down and check the boxes for “Under $10” and also “$10-$50”. To look at laptops, click on the electronics drop-down and check the box next to “laptops”

2. _What progress have you made that is not visible to a common user?_ 

- We continued making progress on making database manipulation intuitive and accessible for our front-end team, and also further implemented a more thorough test suite to ensure the database works as expected. We included image support with blob storage for our database, so that the listings now can display images. We also finalyl figured out the tricky nature of chats+messages being stored in two different tables yet being connected on a strucutral level. We finihsed implemention necessary functions that properly update both tables when new messages are being added in a chat or when en entire chat gets deleted. We also refactored API routes for better error handling and configured GitHub Actions for automated testing.
