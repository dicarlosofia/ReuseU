# Additional Note

Notice our team was a bit confused between the review and the team retrospective (as the deadlines were the same and the documents sound kind of the same). Thus we submitted this review document a bit late. In the future, when we end our team session, we will make sure to assign who does what to make sure this sprint document deadline issue does not happen again.


# Sprint 1 Review Report

Read on below to understand what our team has achieved during this sprint.

## Product Improvement

How has your product improved or progressed from a customer perspective? Describe in terms of high level features that a non-technical user could recognize and appreciate.

Going through the prototyping exercise, we went through multiple iterations of expanding and developing our website's functionality. Upon receiving the feedback from our users (both indisde and outside of the class), we were able to identify some common confusions and user experiences with the website prototype, which ultimately allowed us to change features and design in a way that allowed users to have a better UX overall. For instance, with our initial prototype, our testers/users had some issues understanding how to submit a listing or read about ReuseU as a concept, or read its mission. Recognizing these issues in UX, we updated our website layout and interactive elements available to make it more intuitive to perform these tasks. 

## Progress not visible to a common user

What progress have you made that is not visible to a common user?

On the developers' side, we have really fine tuned our own understanding of the inputs and outputs of our website's behavior. More specifically, we as designers and developers have gained a much better understanding of how our website functions, how its webpages are connected to each other and to the clicklable buttons on each page that the user may interact with. We also have clearly outlined a variety of potential use cases that allowed us to fine grain specific flows that users with different use-intentions can follow. This was especially helpful for our progress as it's a more isolated and focused way to view our website and its functionalty.
