# Sprint 1 Review Report

Read on below to understand what our team has achieved during this sprint.

## Product Improvement

How has your product improved or progressed from a customer perspective? Describe in terms of high level features that a non-technical user could recognize and appreciate.

Going through the prototyping exercise, we went through multiple iterations of expanding and developing our website's functionality. Upon receiving the feedback from our users (both indisde and outside of the class), we were able to identify some common confusions and user experiences with the website prototype, which ultimately allowed us to change features and design in a way that allowed users to have a better UX overall. For instance, with our initial prototype, our testers/users had some issues understanding how to submit a listing or read about ReuseU as a concept, or read its mission. Recognizing these issues in UX, we updated our website layout and interactive elements available to make it more intuitive to perform these tasks.
