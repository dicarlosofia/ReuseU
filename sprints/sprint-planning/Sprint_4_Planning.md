# Sprint 4 Planning Report
## Capacity:
__Consider each team member's availability and how accurate your time estimates were for last week's tasks.__
- Our last sprint's time estimates were pretty accurate and we do not think we need adjustments to the time estimates below:
- Our team can do about 4-5 hours of work per person outside of class time, in addition to
whatever lab time we get in class. We envision having 1-2 team meetings per week outside of
class with as many team members as possible, as well as some asynchronous work outside of
that time.



## Goals and Task Breakdown: 

### Part 1: User-Facing Documentation and Stakeholder Interviews:
1. Create user-facing documentation - [issue link](https://github.com/dicarlosofia/ReuseU/issues/114)
2. Create a list of prompts for stakeholders - [issue link](https://github.com/dicarlosofia/ReuseU/issues/116)
3. Schedule meetings with stakeholders - [issue link](https://github.com/dicarlosofia/ReuseU/issues/115)


### Part 2: Internal Documentation
1. Group 1: Peter, Krishna, Timur
    * Meet up and do the Internal Documentation Lab - [Issue Link](https://github.com/dicarlosofia/ReuseU/issues/117)
2. Group 2: Sofia, Howie, Trung
    * Meet up and do the Internal Documentation Lab - [Issue Link](https://github.com/dicarlosofia/ReuseU/issues/118)


### Part 3: Work towards MVP
* Make sure message and review service CRUD functions work as intended
* Implement all chats and reviews routes
* Implement blob storage in both the database and API for listings
* Add account, chat, and review features on the frontend using the API

### Part 4: Generative AI Experiment
We will implement a feature using AI as part of the product. The default price of an item will be estimated using AI. The AI will have access to prices of similar items...but
this feature becomes exceptionally handy when an item is listed that is not yet available on ReuseU. It may be difficult to gage what something is worth, and thus this feature
will allow users to see a default price even if the item listed is completely disconnected from other items on the site.


## Assignment: (what people will do)
Everyone works on Part 2, since it's a lab exercise that requires everyone's input, even if in separate groups.

Additional work everyone completes: 
* Timur: Working on part 1, creating user-facing documentation, prompt list, and reaching out to stakeholders. 
* Howie: Help scheduling interviews for part 1.
* Krishna: Finish CI/CD development, complete user-facing documentation for part 1, begin work on art elements
* Trung: Work on implementing blob storage API and finish implementing other API routes
* Peter: Setup blob storage on the database end, work on the review price approximation feature. Fix bugs in reviews and chat service functions. 
* Sofia:
