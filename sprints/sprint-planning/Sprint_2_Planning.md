# Sprint 2 Planning Report
## Capacity:
__Consider each team member's availability and how accurate your time estimates were for last week's tasks.__
- Our team can do about 4-5 hours of work per person outside of class time, in addition to
whatever lab time we get in class. We envision to have 1-2 team meetings per week outside of
class with as many team members as possible, as well as some asynchronous work outside of
that time.
- We have established that most of us will not be available to work on Sprint 2 during Spring Break. So to account for this, we will
make sure to get more done before and after. 
- Sofia will be more busy starting *this weekend*, since her season for her sport begins, and she will no
longer be free on weekends to meet.  

## Goals: 
__Name the outcomes you plan to complete this sprint. Consider your backlog and the parameters of this week's milestone.__
1. Coding guidelines
