# Sprint 2 Planning Report
## Capacity:
__Consider each team member's availability and how accurate your time estimates were for last week's tasks.__
- Our team can do about 4-5 hours of work per person outside of class time, in addition to
whatever lab time we get in class. We envision to have 1-2 team meetings per week outside of
class with as many team members as possible, as well as some asynchronous work outside of
that time.
- We have established that most of us will not be available to work on Sprint 2 during Spring Break. So to account for this, we will
make sure to get more done before and after. 
- Sofia will be more busy starting *this weekend*, since her season for her sport begins, and she will no
longer be free on weekends to meet.  

## Goals and Task Breakdown: 
__Name the outcomes you plan to complete this sprint. Consider your backlog and the parameters of this week's milestone.__
1. Coding guidelines 
    * Subtask 1: Create a document that outlines the coding guidelines for the team to follow - [Issue Link](https://github.com/dicarlosofia/ReuseU/issues/42)
    * Subtask 2: Make sure to adjust the README.md file on the main repo page to indicate the existence of coding guidelines and how to find them - [Issue Link](https://github.com/dicarlosofia/ReuseU/issues/42)
2. Data modeling:
    * Subtask 1: Draw an entity-relation diagram to explain our data relation - [Issue Link](https://github.com/dicarlosofia/ReuseU/issues/43)
    * Subtask 2: Provide the schema or otherwise explain data storage - [Issue Link](https://github.com/dicarlosofia/ReuseU/issues/43)
         - If using a database, give the first draft of our database schema.
         - If not, describe how you are storing the data and its organization
3. Software Architecture - Define a clear path for the development of the prototype.
https://github.com/dicarlosofia/ReuseU/issues/46 (Software Architecture defining)
https://github.com/dicarlosofia/ReuseU/issues/41 (Architecture assumptions)
https://github.com/dicarlosofia/ReuseU/issues/40 (System Architecture diagram)
https://github.com/dicarlosofia/ReuseU/issues/39 (Major Data Storage Components)
4. Software Design - Provide additional detail about components 
https://github.com/dicarlosofia/ReuseU/issues/44 (Software Design explanation)
https://github.com/dicarlosofia/ReuseU/issues/38 (specify interfaces between components at a high level)
5. Continuous Integration Plan:
    * Subtask 1: Create dev and official releases containing the HTMl/CSS/React/Javascript and python code. The dev build should be a relatively up to date combination of code. The official release should have a series of unit tests that need to pass prior to being pushed. 
7. Set up testing framework
   * Subtask 1: The Mocha Javascript testing library needs to be setup for the front end components.
   * Subtask 2: The libraryUunittest works well for python (our backend language), there should also some data validation checks here as well.



## Assignment:
__What will each team member do this sprint?__
* Howie - Coding guidelines, requirement movement, major software components defining, component connection
* Timur - I will work on goal 1, coding guidelines and will create the document for it, as well as adjust the README.md file to indicate the guidelines' existence and how to find them.
* Sofia - Issue tracking, software components (co-authoring pt.2 with Howie), Epics creation, helping integrate Vercel
* Peter -
* Krishna -
* Trung -
