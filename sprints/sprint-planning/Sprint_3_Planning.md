# Sprint 3 Planning Report
## Capacity:
__Consider each team member's availability and how accurate your time estimates were for last week's tasks.__
- Our team can do about 4-5 hours of work per person outside of class time, in addition to
whatever lab time we get in class. We envision having 1-2 team meetings per week outside of
class with as many team members as possible, as well as some asynchronous work outside of
that time.



## Goals and Task Breakdown: 
Name the outcomes you plan to complete this sprint. Consider your backlog and the parameters of this week's milestone.
Overall: Work with your project group to complete an initial, end-to-end implementation of your product that a user can interact with.

## Assignment: (what people will do)
Backend: Peter and Sofia (who is joining backend starting this sprint) will be completing the CRUD functions for the database so that it runs correctly, as well as the tests to make sure that the database gets modified correctly. Blob storage will be implemented, and the authentication framework will be selected and executed. Trung will implement RESTful API suite, securely exposing the backend functions and configuring for deploying Flask application.
Frontend: Timur will join Howie to continue developing the frontend components
Testing: Krishna will take charge of testing and will collaborate with both the frontend and backend teams to figure out relevant test suites.
