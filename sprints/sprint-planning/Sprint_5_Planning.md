# Sprint 5 Planning Report
## Capacity:
__Consider each team member's availability and how accurate your time estimates were for last week's tasks.__
- Our last sprint's time estimates were pretty accurate and we do not think we need adjustments to the time estimates below:
- Our team can do about 4-5 hours of work per person outside of class time, in addition to
whatever lab time we get in class. We envision having 1-2 team meetings per week outside of
class with as many team members as possible, as well as some asynchronous work outside of
that time.
