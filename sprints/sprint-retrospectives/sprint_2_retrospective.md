What went well or as expected last sprint?

What do you want to keep about your process for next sprint?

What went badly or contrary to your expectations?

What do you want to add or change about your process for next sprint?

How were your team's group work dynamics last sprint?

Now would be a good time for some real talk discussing any miscommunication, confusion, or interpersonal friction that happened in the past week. Be open and honest with your teammates and try to clear the air between yourselves as an investment in your future harmonious collaboration.
Revisit and revise group norms as needed.

You don't need to make a written record of everything from the retrospective. Sprint retrospective is a chance to speak freely with each other about the good, the bad, and the ugly of this past sprint.
